#### What is databasae ?

- A database is an organized collection of structured information or data stored electronically in a computer system. It can includes words, numbers, images , videos and other types of files.

#### What is data ?

- Data refers to raw facts, numbers or symbols that, when processed or analyzed become meaningful information. It can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured and is essential for making informed decisions in various domains such as business, technology and research. In the context of web development data is often stored in database, retrieved through APIS and processed to deliver dynamic user experiences.

#### What is information ?

- Information is processed, organized, or structured data that provides meaning or context. When raw data is analyzed and interpreted, it becomes useful information that helps in decision-making.

##### Key Differences Between Data and Information

| **Aspect**     | **Data**                                             | **Information**                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | Raw, unprocessed facts, numbers, or symbols.         | Processed and meaningful data that provides context.     |
| **Meaning**    | Lacks context and alone does not convey meaning.     | Has context and is useful for decision-making.           |
| **Example**    | "100, 90, 80" (Just numbers).                        | "A student scored 90% on the test" (Meaningful insight). |
| **Structure**  | Can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. | Always structured and organized.                         |
| **Use Case**   | Stored in databases, logs, or spreadsheets.          | Used for reports, analysis, and decision-making.         |

#### What is DBMS and Why ?

- A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that enables the creation, management, and manipulation of databases. It provides an interface for users and applications to interact with the data stored in a database, ensuring data integrity, security, and consistency.

Key Components of DBMS:

- Data Storage: Organizes data efficiently to minimize redundancy.
- Data Retrieval: Facilitates querying and accessing data.
- Data Manipulation: Allows users to insert, update, and delete data.
- Security: Controls access to data and provides authentication mechanisms.
- Backup and Recovery: Ensures data is saved and can be restored in case of failures.

Why Use a DBMS?

- Data Handling: Simplifies complex data operations and enhances efficiency.
- Data Integrity: Maintains accuracy and consistency through constraints and rules.
- Multi-user Access: Supports multiple users accessing data simultaneously while maintaining data integrity.
- Data Security: Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access.
  Scalability: Handles large volumes of data and supports growing business needs.
